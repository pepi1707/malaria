Extend the idea in [malaria hero](https://blog.insightdatascience.com/https-blog-insightdatascience-com-malaria-hero-a47d3d5fc4bb) to something more productive.

## Current examination procedure

* The sample - a drop of blood plus some chemicals - is smeared between two glasses. Our current understanding is that this part of the procedure is not a problem in the malaria affected countries. It is the examination that is very labor intensive and error prone.
* A clinician observes the sample under a microscope at 100x magnification. They must count at least 5000 red blood cells and tell how many of them are infected (coloured bluish by the chemical). A single red blood cell is about $8\muM$ in diameter.
