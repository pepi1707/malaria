    "\n",
    "* The sample - a drop of blood - is smeared between two glasses. Then some chemical is added for staining and fixation. There are two types of blood smear: **thin** and **thick** films. TODO: which one is being used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our current understanding is that this part of the procedure is not a problem in the malaria affected countries. It is the examination that is very labor intensive and error prone.\n",
    "* A clinician observes the sample under a microscope at 100x magnification. They must count at least 5000 red blood cells and tell how many of them are infected (coloured bluish by the chemical). A single red blood cell is about $8\\mu m$ in diameter.\n",

    "## Technical questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How many pixels do we need for 5000 RBC to be observable?\n",
    "  * Is it possible to have all the 5000 RBCs in a single shot?\n",
    "* How much magnification do we need if we use a decent smartphone camera (e.g. 10MP)?\n",
    "* If it is required to take multiple photos to reach 5000 RBCs, how can we ensure that the clinician is not shooting overlapping areas?\n",
    "  * Option1: Detect this algorithmically and reject the test\n",
    "  * Option2: Custom made microscopic device that holds the sample still and lets the user slide it e.g. by 1mm. We can also use this for the back light.\n",
    "* Are all blood smear glasses standard in size?\n",
